# Smith & Williams Trucking - Setup Instructions

## ⚠️ Important: Python Environment Setup

You received a warning about installing packages in a "public environment" because you're installing directly to your system Python. This is generally not recommended for projects. Here's how to properly set up your environment:

## Current Status

✅ **reportlab is installed correctly** at:
- Location: `C:\Users\Chica\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\Lib\site-packages`
- Version: 4.4.3
- The app will work as-is

## Recommended: Use a Virtual Environment

A virtual environment keeps your project dependencies isolated from your system Python. This prevents conflicts between projects.

### Option 1: Quick Setup (Recommended)

1. **Run the setup script:**
   ```bash
   setup_environment.bat
   ```
   This will:
   - Create a virtual environment
   - Install all required packages
   - Set everything up automatically

2. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   streamlit run app_v2_fixed.py
   ```

### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # You'll see (venv) in your terminal prompt
   ```

3. **Install packages in the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas pillow reportlab
   ```

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app_v2_fixed.py
   ```

### Option 3: Continue with Current Setup

If you want to continue using your current setup (system Python), everything is working correctly:

```bash
streamlit run app_v2_fixed.py
```

## Why Use Virtual Environments?

1. **Isolation:** Each project has its own dependencies
2. **No Conflicts:** Different projects can use different package versions
3. **Clean Uninstall:** Easy to remove all project dependencies
4. **Reproducibility:** Others can recreate your exact environment

## Current Installation Details

- **Python:** 3.13.5
- **Location:** `C:\Users\Chica\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313`
- **Packages installed globally:**
  - streamlit
  - pandas
  - pillow
  - reportlab

## To Check Your Setup

Run this command to verify everything is working:
```bash
python -c "import streamlit, pandas, PIL, reportlab; print('✅ All packages installed correctly!')"
```

## Need Help?

If you encounter any issues:
1. The app is currently working with your global installation
2. PDF generation is functional
3. All features are operational

The warning you saw is just a recommendation, not an error. Your app is fully functional!
