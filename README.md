## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/trailer-move-tracker.git
   cd trailer-move-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure secrets**:
   - Edit `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
   - Set your password: `password = "your_secure_password"`
   - (Optional) Add Google Maps API key: `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = "your_api_key"`

4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Access the app**:
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501`
   - Enter your password to access the application

## üîß Configuration

### Setting Up Password Protection

Edit `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:
```toml
password = "your_secure_password_here"
```

### Google Maps API Setup (Optional)

1. Get an API key from [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Enable the **Distance Matrix API** for your project
3. Add the key to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`:
   ```toml
   GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
   ```

The app works perfectly without the API key - you'll just need to enter mileage manually.
