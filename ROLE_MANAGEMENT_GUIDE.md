The user can now switch between roles using the sidebar dropdown!

## Available Roles

- `'business_administrator'` - Full system control
- `'operations_coordinator'` - Manage moves and assignments
- `'driver'` - Upload PODs, view assignments
- `'viewer'` - Read-only access to dashboards

## Role Progression Path

Typical progression:
1. Start as `viewer` (trainee learning the system)
2. Upgrade to `driver` (can now handle deliveries)
3. Add `operations_coordinator` (dual role - can self-assign and help manage)
4. Potentially promote to `business_administrator` (full control)

## Notes

- Users with driver role automatically appear in driver assignment list
- Dual-role users see a role switcher dropdown in sidebar
- Viewer role is perfect for clients or trainees who need read-only access
- Changes require editing the code and redeploying
